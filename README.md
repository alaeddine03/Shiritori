# Shiritori
Shiritori is a traditional Japanese word game in which players take turns saying words that begin with the last letter of the previous word. The game continues until a player cannot come up with a valid word, and that player loses. The objective is to challenge your vocabulary and quick thinking skills.

# How to Play

1-Decide the order of play.

2-The first player starts by saying a word out loud, for example, "apple."

3-The next player must say a word that begins with the last letter of the previous word, in this case, "elephant."

4-The game continues with each player taking turns.

5-The game ends when a player:

-Repeats a word that has already been used in the game.

-Cannot think of a word within a reasonable time limit (e.g., 10 seconds).

6-The last player remaining in the game is the winner!

# Rules

1-Words must be in the chosen language (e.g., English, Japanese).

2-Proper nouns (names of people, places, or things) are generally not allowed.

3-Players can't use the same word twice in a single game.

4-Setting a time limit for each turn is optional but can make the game more challenging.

5-Feel free to use a dictionary or reference materials if disputes arise over word validity.
